# CHS CODING 

Welcome to the CHS Coding repository. This is where you can go to find examples of the files we've worked on in the past, as well as downloads and a general info.

Downloads
-------------

You'll need a couple things to get started.

* Python: This is the program we'll be working in. Note that there are two versions of Python (version 3 and 2). **MAKE SURE YOU DOWNLOAD VERSION 3!** Here is the link for the [Windows installer](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.4.3/python-3.4.3.msi). If you have a Mac and have OS X 10.6 or greater, use [this installer](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.4.3/python-3.4.3-macosx10.6.pkg), otherwise, try [this one](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.4.3/python-3.4.3-macosx10.5.pkg).
* Head First Programming: This is the book we're working through together. You can [download it here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zdj6uqeojnveg19/Head_First_Programming.pdf?dl=0). I've added some sticky notes to it, make sure you click on those!

Head First Programming Errata
-------------------------------
In Chapter 2 of the book, it walks you through downloading text form a website. However, the website was moved since the book was created.

On Page 50, instead of http://www.beans-r-us.biz/prices.html, use http://beans-r-us.appspot.com/prices.html. Also, use this changed address on all future pages.

Introductoin
----------------
I said this before on our first meeting, but to reiterate, or to tell people who may just be joining...

This is not "coding class." This is "coding club." You can't learn to program working two hours a week. You have to put a bit more into it than that. So to start, we're going to walk through Head First Programming. It's a good introductory book, and gets you used to doing programming the "real way."

After we're done with that, things will probably become a bit more freeform. Maybe we'll build some websites, maybe do some robotics.  But it'll be something fun.

For now, please download Head First Programming, above, and then get started. I'd like everyone to be done with Chapter 2 by Thursday, the 23rd. Being done with Chatper 3 would be even better.
