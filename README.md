You'll need a couple things to get started.

* Python: This is the program we'll be working in. Note that there are two versions of Python (version 3 and 2). **MAKE SURE YOU DOWNLOAD VERSION 3!** [Here is the link for the Windows installer.](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.4.3/python-3.4.3.msi) If you have a Mac, use [this version](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.4.3/python-3.4.3-macosx10.6.pkg) if you're on OSX 10.6 or greater. Otherwise, try [this one](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.4.3/python-3.4.3-macosx10.5.pkg).
* Head First Programming: This is the book we're working through together. You can [download it here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zdj6uqeojnveg19/Head_First_Programming.pdf?dl=0).
